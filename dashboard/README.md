## Known limitation

Fuel-mix columns (`avg_renewable_share`, `avg_fossil_share`, `regional_*_share`, `total_generation_mwh`, `avg_residual_load_mw`) are currently **NULL** for non-PL zones — the ENTSO-E generation endpoint returns payloads `entsoe-py 0.7.11` can't parse for post-2024 data. Build the generation-based panels last so you notice the gap. Price-only comparisons (the Eastern-vs-Southern story) are fully populated.

## Pages & charts

### Page 1 — Regional overview
1. **Scorecard**: `regional_avg_price_eur_mwh` grouped by `region` (Eastern / Southern), last 30 days. Source: `fct_eu_regional_summary`.
2. **Time series (line)**: `regional_avg_price_eur_mwh` over `date`, series = `region`. Shows the Eastern–Southern spread.
3. **Bar**: `regional_negative_price_hours` summed by `region` over last 90 days — highlights Southern duck-curve negative pricing.

### Page 2 — Country drilldown
4. **Stacked bar**: `avg_price_eur_mwh` per `country` per `date` (filtered to last 60 days). Source: `fct_eu_daily_by_region`.
5. **Heatmap**: `avg_price_eur_mwh` by `zone_code` × `date`. Shows IT bidding-zone divergence.

### Page 3 — Duck curve
6. **Line**: `avg_price_eur_mwh` by `hour_utc`, one series per `region`. Source: `fct_eu_duck_curve`, filtered to spring/summer months (solar-heavy). Southern shows characteristic midday dip.

### Page 4 — Poland & commodity drivers
7. **Dual-axis line**: PL daily `avg_price_eur_mwh` (`fct_daily_prices`, date field = `price_date`) vs `close_price` (`fct_commodity_drivers` filtered to `ticker='TTF_GAS'`, date field = `price_date`, blended on date).
8. **Line**: `close_price` by `price_date` for `BRENT`, `NAT_GAS_HH`, `EURPLN` — commodity/FX drivers.

### Page 5 — Real-time demand
9. **Line**: `demand_mw` by `event_ts` from `fct_intraday_demand` (populated by the streaming stack at `docker compose up`).
